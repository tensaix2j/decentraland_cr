The game mechanic basically utilizes Chain Reaction to achieve the goal of terminating all the human subjects in the containment using the items provided within the time constraint. 


There are 4 types of items available with different quantities depending on the level difficulties. 

### 1. Zombie Virus
Contagious virus that turns humans into zombies. Zombies can then attack other humans and turn more humans into zombies. Hence trigger a chain reaction of Zombie Apocalypse.

### 2. Empty Block
Just an empty block for blocking purposes.

### 3. Oil Barrel
Flamable object that can explode if being ignited with fire. 

### 4. Fire Blast
Combustion within a small area that can start to ignite a chain reaction of explosion if flamables are kept around the object.

This is a game created for Decentraland Game Jam 2020 (Theme: Chain Reaction)

The game mechanics basically revolves around Chain Reaction to achieve the goal of terminating all the human subjects in the containment using the items provided within the time constraint. 

There are 4 types of items available with different quantities depending on the level difficulties.

Contagious virus that turns humans into zombies. Zombies can then attack other humans and turn more humans into zombies. Hence trigger a chain reaction of Zombie Apocalypse.

### 2. Empty Block
Just an empty block for blocking purposes.

### 3. Oil Barrel
Flamable object that can explode if being ignited with fire. 

### 4. Fire Blast
Combustion within a small area that can start to ignite a chain reaction of explosion if flamables are kept around the object.

The game mechanic basically utilizes Chain Reaction to achieve the goal of terminating all the human subjects in the containment using the items provided within the time constraint. 




There are 4 types of items available with different quantities depending on the level difficulties. 

### 1. Zombie Virus
Contagious virus that turns humans into zombies. Zombies can then attack other humans and turn more humans into zombies. Hence trigger a chain reaction of Zombie Apocalypse.
